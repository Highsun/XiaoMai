**Electronic Ticketing System**  
Software Engineering Course Assignment, 2022  
University of Electronic Science and Technology of China

## Introduction

**XiaoMai** is a lightweight, cross-platform **electronic ticketing application** designed for educational and prototyping purposes. Developed as part of the Software Engineering course at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, this system showcases a clean separation of concerns between a modern **Vue.js-based frontend** and a **Flask-powered backend API**.

The application allows users to interact with a mock ticketing platform in real time, simulating key features of a production-level system such as:

- UI-based ticket browsing and selection
- Backend data communication via RESTful APIs
- Modular architecture supporting future feature expansion

The entire stack emphasizes **ease of deployment**, **development clarity**, and **team collaboration**, making XiaoMai an ideal learning foundation for teams exploring full-stack web app development.

> **Built with**: JavaScript (Vue.js) & Python (Flask)
> **Version control**: Git + GitHub for real-world collaboration
